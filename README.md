## About

Welcome to this cherished, hidden corner of the internet! This app celebrates the cooking of my cherished Grandma Jeanette. üíõ </br>

My Grandma was born in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Growing up she watched her mother Lucy cook in the kitchen. Infused with love, care, and Italian authenticity in everything she made, Grandma Lucy's cooking was a treat and a treasure. Her approach was grounded in a few core principles: Keep it simple. Do not waste food. Share with others.</br>

Grandma Jeanette learned from the best, while adding her own twist. It's the blessing of a lifetime to enjoy cooking with my grandma and to learn from someone who knows the kitchen so well. With this website, I hope to keep the Priolo/DeGaetano culinary traditions alive.</br>

Thank you for visiting!</br>
