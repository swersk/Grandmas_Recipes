              to this cherished, hidden corner of the internet! This page
              celebrates the cooking of our wonderful Grandma Jeanette.
              <br />
              <br />
              Grandma was blessed to be born in the best place on Earth: Bay
              Ridge, Brooklyn. Growing up she watched her mother Lucy cook in
              the kitchen. Infused with love, care, and Italian authenticity in
              everything she made, Grandma Lucy's cooking was a treat and a
              treasure. Her approach was grounded in a few core principles: Keep
              it simple. Do not waste food. Share with others.
              <br />
              <br />
              Grandma Jeanette learned from the best, while adding her own
              twist. For example, she cuts string beans with a scissor and not
              by hand. Grandma Lucy might call that 'wasteful' but we might just
              say that Grandma is modern. ðŸ˜Š
              <br />
              <br />
              It's the blessing of a lifetime to enjoy cooking with my grandma
              and to learn from someone who knows the kitchen so well. With this
              website, I hope to keep the Priolo/DeGaetano culinary traditions
              alive.
