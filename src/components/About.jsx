        <span className="font-dancing-bold text-5xl">Welcome </span> <span className="font-satoshi-regular text-xl">to this cherished, hidden corner of the internet! This page celebrates the cooking of our wonderful Grandma Jeanette.
          <br /><br />
          Grandma was blessed to be born in the best place on Earth: Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Growing up she watched her mother Lucy cook in the kitchen. Infused with love, care, and Italian authenticity in everything she made, Grandma Lucy's cooking was a treat and a treasure.
          Her approach was grounded in a few core principles: Keep it simple. Do not waste food. Share with others.
          <br /><br />
          Grandma Jeanette learned from the best, while adding her own twist. For example, she cuts string beans with a scissor and not by hand. Grandma Lucy might call that 'wasteful' but we might just say that Grandma is modern. ðŸ˜Š
          <br /><br />
          It's the blessing of a lifetime to enjoy cooking with my grandma and to learn from someone who knows the kitchen so well. With this website, I hope to keep the Priolo/DeGaetano culinary traditions alive.
          <br /><br />
          Thank you for visiting!
